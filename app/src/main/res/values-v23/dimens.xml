        Scalable SDP dimensions are used throughout this app.
        Check gradle for dependency.

        Why use SDP?
        Instead of using dimensions file and setting different dimensions
        for different screen sizes, we can utilize the SDP dependency
        which will scale the size unit with any screen size.
